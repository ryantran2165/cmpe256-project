## Notebook Explainations

### eda

Some general exploratory code and graphs can be found in this notebook. Examples include investigating the distributions of continuous features, how many categorical features have unique values, and summary statistics. Additionally, there is code for cleaning and eliminating features that have a single value, duplicate features, or all missing values. The most popular artists, songs, and average play counts are presented, along with some additional exploration of using variousÂ queries. 

### ensemble_svd_neucf

The code used to generate the Matrix Factorization and Neural Collaborative Filtering Ensemble findings is included in this notebook. It includes feature pre-processing code as well as code for executing the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and analyzing techniques for determining the best model using RMSE. 

### filter_train_triplets

This notebook includes some extra scripts for filtering the dataset so that each song has been listened to by at least 200 people and each user has listened to at least 20 songs. 

### genre

The code for producing predictions for users based on the genres they listen to is contained in this notebook. 

### joining_song_genres

The code for parsing and loading the music genres datafile is included in this notebook.

### loading_data

This notebook contains all of the code required to generate the song and artist metadata datasets (except for genres).

### split_data

The code for creating the training and testing datasets for the Stacking Ensemble approach is included in this notebook.

### svd 

This notebook contains the code for evaluating SVD with 5-fold cross validation and ratings ranging from 1 to 5. This is the baseline SVD for the Stacking Ensemble method.

### train_triplets_filtered_ratings

The scripts for converting the play_count into a rating scale are contained in this notebook. 

## Recreating Results
